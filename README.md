# HTN Plan Verification as Planning

This repository contains code to verify HTN plans. It needs two files as input:

* A file with the HTN model grounded by the PANDA grounder
* A file with the solution to verify

Call the program with these two files, e.g., "verificationAsPlanning [model-file-name] [plan-file-name]". Examples of these files can be found in the folder "example-input" in this repository.
The program performs a reachability analysis (which might solve the verification task) and writes a planning problem afterwards, which has a solution if and only if the solution is a valid solution for the input planning problem. This file has -- just as the input -- the format that is generated by the PANDA grounder. You can, e.g., use a solver from the PANDA framework to solve it (examples are given in the "example-input" folder).

If you use the code, please cite the following paper:

So far, the approach has been used by the TOAD system (see [1]).
